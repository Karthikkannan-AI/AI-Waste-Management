## Introduction ##

The current waste management systems are unable to efficiently deal with the tons of garbage thatâ€™s generated every day. Automating the processes of garbage sorting and disposal, by switching to AI for smart recycling and waste management, is expected to bring in better disposal methods to recycle sustainably.

The current waste segregation methods include manual segregation of waste. We present an effective system
which segregates waste based on supervised machine learning algorithms and classify the the waste into
shredded paper waste, crushed paper waste, news paper waste,food waste, packaged foods waste, PET bottle waste, plastic cover waste, e-waste, plastic material waste.

### AI on the Edge ###

Edge AI is a system that uses Deep Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level. The device does not need to be connected to the Internet to process such data and make decisions in real-time, in a matter of milliseconds. This considerably reduces the communication costs derived from the cloud model.

## Conclusion ##

This project is purely done for Demonstration purposes.The proposed Edge AI based system presents a simple and an effective method to classify the waste using Deep Learning, thus completely removing human intervention in the segregation stage.

## Rebounding from COVID-19 ##

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the lives of most people on the planet.

Like every business across the World, we too got impacted and affected by Coronavirus.

We are navigating the business impact of Covid-19 through self-motivation and Innovation.

This work is part of our journey towards Recovery and Reinvention.
